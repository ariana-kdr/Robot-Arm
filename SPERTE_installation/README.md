# SPERTE

**Welcome to the SPERTE project.**

This project intends to make real-time experiments on (motion)systems easier to perform.
It is intended as a replacement for the real-time ubuntu laptops or usb images that were previously used.
It does so by leveraging:

- A Raspberry Pi running the RT PREEMPT kernel.
- Simulink/Matlab support packages for the Raspberry Pi.
- Custom drivers to interact with the TU/e E-box system.
- Tools and scripts to make interaction with the model easier.

# Providing feedback
Please submit any problems or bugs as issues using the dicsussion page on Canvas.
This makes sure we are aware of any bugs or problems and increases the likelyhood that it will get fixed.
