***ACCEPT COLLABORATION INVITE BEFORE MAKING CHANGES IN THE REPOSITORY***

Most of the files on Canvas under the Software module can be found in this repository already and can be downloaded directly as one .zip file. The exceptions to this are the driver file for the robot's camera, which is too large to be uploaded here, and an empty folder called 'measurements' (SPERTE_Installation\Examples\Models\Control_Engineering\measurements) that could not be made here since GitHub doesn't let you create an empty folder. 

_PREREQUISITES_

  SPERTE
  
  • MATLAB 2018b - 2021a
  
  • MATLAB coder toolbox
  
  • Simulink coder toolbox
  
  • Embedded coder toolbox (optional)
  
  
  • Signal processing toolbox (optional)
  • MATLAB Support for MinGW-w64 C/C++ Compiler
  
  • MATLAB support package for Raspberry Pi hardware (select the Install Later option)

  After installing the appropriate version of MATLAB, the toolboxes and the packages, follow SPERTE_installation.pdf and 4GB20_Connecting_to_the_Pi.docx to set things up correctly. An example file Control_Engineering_example.m has been provided for testing SPERTE after this, but before it can be run Reference_model_Control_Engineering.slx has to be opened and run first in Simulink
